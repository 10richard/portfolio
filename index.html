            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                As a self-taught <strong>full-stack developer</strong>, I have dedicated <strong>over 
                two years to honing my skills</strong> in both front-end and back-end development. 
                The art of programming captivates me, particularly the exhilarating journey of problem-solving. 
                I thrive on overcoming challenges and finding solutions to problems - which web development is a
                perfect outlet for!
            </p>
            <p>
                With a solid grasp of full-stack development. I'm comfortable at implementing 
                <strong>responsive</strong> user interfaces, while simultaneously architecting 
                <strong>structured and scalable</strong> back-end systems.
